description: "A digital key, also known as a virtual key or e-key, refers to a secure digital authentication credential that grants access to a physical space or digital resource. In the context of physical access control, a digital key is often a smartphone app or electronic token that replaces traditional physical keys or access cards. It uses encryption and authentication protocols to verify the identity of the holder and authorize access to doors, gates, vehicles, or other secured areas. Digital keys are also used in digital rights management to grant access to online content, software, or services, typically through unique codes or login credentials."
