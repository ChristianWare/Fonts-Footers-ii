## Key Components of CRM

<br />
### Customer Data Management CRM systems centralize customer data from various sources,
including contact information, communication history, purchase history, preferences,
and interactions across different channels (such as emails, phone calls, social media,
and website visits).

### Contact Management

CRM software allows businesses to organize and segment customer contacts based on criteria such as demographics, buying behavior, engagement level, and customer lifecycle stage. This segmentation helps in targeting specific customer segments with personalized messages and offers.

### Sales Automation
