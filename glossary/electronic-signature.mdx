title: "Electronic Signature"
description: "An electronic signature refers to a digital representation of a person's handwritten signature or mark that is created, transmitted, and stored electronically. It is used to indicate consent, approval, or authentication in electronic documents or transactions, eliminating the need for physical signatures on paper documents. Electronic signatures can take various forms, including scanned images of handwritten signatures, digital signatures generated using cryptographic techniques, or electronic symbols or codes attached to documents to signify the signer's identity and intent. They are widely used in digital contracts, agreements, forms, and other documents to streamline workflows, enhance security, and facilitate remote and paperless transactions."
