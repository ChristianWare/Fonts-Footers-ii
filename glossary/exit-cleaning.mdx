title: "Exit Cleaning"
description: "Exit cleaning, also known as move-out cleaning or end-of-lease cleaning, refers to the thorough cleaning of a property or rental unit when a tenant or occupant is moving out. It is typically performed to ensure that the property is left in a clean and tidy condition, meeting the standards required by landlords, property managers, or leasing agreements. Exit cleaning is important for tenants to receive their security deposit back and for landlords to prepare the property for new occupants."
